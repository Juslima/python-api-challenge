# Temperature vs. Latitude:

The linear regression plots show the relationship between temperature and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

In the Northern Hemisphere, there is a negative linear relationship between temperature and latitude. As latitude increases (moving away from the equator), the maximum temperature decreases. The r-value of -0.767 indicates a moderately strong negative correlation, suggesting that there is a fairly consistent trend of decreasing temperature with increasing latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.

In the Southern Hemisphere, there is a positive linear relationship between temperature and latitude. As latitude increases (moving closer to the equator), the maximum temperature also increases. The r-value of 0.822 indicates a moderately strong positive correlation, suggesting that there is a fairly consistent trend of increasing temperature with increasing latitude in the Southern Hemisphere.

Overall, these linear regression plots demonstrate the general relationship between temperature and latitude in the two hemispheres. They confirm that as we move away from the equator, temperatures tend to decrease in the Northern Hemisphere and increase in the Southern Hemisphere.

# Humidity vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
The linear regression plots show the relationship between humidity and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

In the Northern Hemisphere, there is a very weak negative linear relationship between humidity and latitude. The r-value of -0.057 indicates a nearly negligible correlation. This suggests that there is no consistent trend between humidity and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.

In the Southern Hemisphere, there is also a very weak positive linear relationship between humidity and latitude. The r-value of 0.116 indicates a very weak correlation. This suggests that there is no consistent trend between humidity and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere either.

Based on these linear regression plots and their respective r-values, it can be concluded that latitude has minimal influence on humidity in both hemispheres. Other factors such as local climate patterns, proximity to bodies of water, and elevation might have a more significant impact on humidity levels.

# Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
The linear regression plots show the relationship between cloudiness and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

In the Northern Hemisphere, there is a very weak negative linear relationship between cloudiness and latitude. The r-value of -0.007 indicates an almost negligible correlation. This suggests that there is no significant trend between cloudiness and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.

Similarly, in the Southern Hemisphere, there is a very weak negative linear relationship between cloudiness and latitude. The r-value of -0.048 also indicates a very weak correlation. This implies that there is no notable trend between cloudiness and latitude in the Southern Hemisphere.

Based on these linear regression plots and their respective r-values, it can be concluded that latitude has minimal influence on cloudiness in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Cloudiness is influenced by various other factors such as atmospheric conditions, wind patterns, and local topography, which may overshadow any direct relationship with latitude.

# Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
The linear regression plots show the relationship between wind speed and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere.

In the Northern Hemisphere, there is a very weak positive linear relationship between wind speed and latitude. The r-value of 0.060 indicates a very weak correlation. This suggests that there is no significant trend between wind speed and latitude in the Northern Hemisphere.

In the Southern Hemisphere, there is a weak negative linear relationship between wind speed and latitude. The r-value of -0.242 indicates a weak correlation. This suggests that there is a slight tendency for wind speed to decrease slightly as we move closer to the equator in the Southern Hemisphere.

Based on these linear regression plots and their respective r-values, it can be concluded that latitude has a minimal influence on wind speed in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Other factors such as local topography, atmospheric pressure systems, and proximity to large bodies of water may have a more significant impact on wind speed than latitude alone.
